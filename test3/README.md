## TEST 3: Data Processing

1. This solution processes a CSV dataset to identify properties sold below the average price per square foot, enabling quick insights into undervalued properties.

2. The script reads and validates structured CSV data to ensure accurate calculations.

3. It computes the average price per square foot dynamically from the dataset.

4. Records priced below the calculated average are filtered efficiently.

5. The output is written to a new CSV file, ensuring the original data remains unchanged.

6. The implementation is lightweight, dependency-free, and optimized for clarity and performance.



```bash
cd test3
python3 main.py
```

**Output**: A new file named `sales_below_avg.csv` will be generated in the `test3` directory.
